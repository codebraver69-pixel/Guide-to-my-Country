# Guide-to-my-Country
Firstly I used GPT to get the info due to the time restraints
also i asked for some help with the css ideas so i can understand them.
The stuff i learned from this project:
hover which chnges how something looks when your cursor is above it
The flex display which is sort of like the parent/child classes in python
the flex wrap which helps content to be viewed on dif lines in the same parent class(container)
the justify which automatically spaces the words correctly based on the flex
box shadow which creates a shadow(not that important but it makes the box look cleaner)
the grid template column/row which specifies how many columns/rows we need(with width)
the info is limited since i got lots of exams this week but i hope it's better than the first draft :)
